    A concise, memorable slogan for use in a national campaign aimed at British teenagers
    Imagine it on the side of every second bus in London or on billboards across the UK.
    The slogan should be concise and one that people will remember for years,
    like "Just do it" from Nike or "Think different" from Apple.
    It could be accompanied by an impactful image but the focus is on the wording.

wordings:
  - "Smoking kills"
  - "Smoking is uncool"
  - "Smoking will give you cancer"
  - "No one will want to kiss you if you stink of cigarette smoke"
  - "Smoking makes you slow"
  - "Look at old people who smoke. They wish they hadn't started at your age"
